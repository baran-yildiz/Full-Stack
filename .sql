Insurance carriers, brokers, managing general agents (MGAs) and reinsurance companies sense an opportunity to enter this new market. Startups will also play a critical role in disrupting this market with new technology, offering relevant and effective solutions. For example, GetmeIns, an Israeli insurtech, focuses on fraud detection at the point of sale, using military-grade intelligence to help insurers lower their loss ratio. Getmelns also uses IoT devices to help car insurance providers reduce fraud.

Driving adoption are greater awareness of threats, media reports of losses, third-party demands, and demands from senior management.

(28, 'customer centric approach // smart contracting', '<p>An insurer once asked me: \"Rick, will the blockchain replace insurance as we know it?\". My tongue-in-cheek answer was \"No, not entirely!\". The truth is that nobody yet really knows how far insurance can go with blockchain technology, but that doesn’t stop it being one of the hottest topics for the industry right now. </p><p>Hype or reality? First, some context...</p><p>Last September, the World Economic Forum published a report entitled, “Deep Shift – Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impact”. The report is based on surveys with over 800 executives and experts about new technologies and innovations. The point of the report is to identify deep shifts in society that result from new technologies. These include areas such as 3D printing, driverless cars, wearables and artificial intelligence.</p><p>I was drawn to shift number 16, simply called “Bitcoin and the blockchain”. By 2025, 58% of these experts and executives believed we would hit the tipping point for Bitcoin and blockchain. This was defined as;</p><p>“10% of global gross domestic product will be stored on blockchain technology”</p><p>To put that into context, the total worth of Bitcoin today in the blockchain is circa 0.025% of today’s $80trillion global GDP.</p><p>Also of interest, especially given that it looks like Tunisia will be the first country to issue a digital currency on a blockchain, shift number 18 was called “Governments and the blockchain”. Here, almost 3 out of 4 of the survey group expected that “Governments would collect tax via a blockchain by 2023”.</p><h3>It’s a reality then!</h3><p>It’s certainly looks that way. And $500m of VC money in 2015 can’t be wrong, can it?</p><p>The prospect of a seismic shift on a par with the impact of the Internet is massively compelling. Which explains all the attention, predictions and excitement about blockchain. But, if we use the evolution of the Internet as a benchmark, the development of blockchain today for commercial use is equivalent to the Internet in, say, the mid 1990s’ at best.</p><p>The debates on with or without Bitcoin, private or public blockchains, Sybase vs Oracle (oops, wrong century) are yet to play out. The ability of the Bitcoin blockchain to scale to handle massive volumes at lightening speed remains unproven.</p><p>Now, just as it was in 1995, blockchain technology is at an embryonic stage. Still finding its way; yet to prove it is a viable, industrial strength, large-scale technology capable of solving world hunger.</p><p>Which is why I am going to focus on the use case for insurance, rather than the technology itself. (For one explanation of how Blockchain works, go to Wired, here.)</p><h3>The Smart Insurance Contract</h3><p>This is getting most attention right now. The notion of automating the insurance policy once it is written into a smart contract is compelling. The idea that it will pay out against the insurable event without the policyholder having to a make a claim or the insurer having to administer the claim has significant attractions.</p><p>First, the cost of claims processing simply goes away. Second, the opportunity for fraud largely goes away too. (I hesitate on this one simply because it is theoretical and not yet proven). Third, customer satisfaction must go up!</p><p>One example being used to illustrate how these might work came from the London Fintech Week Blockchain Hackathon last September. Here a team called InsurETH built a flight insurance product over a weekend on the Ethereum platform.</p><p>The use case is simple. In the twelve months to May 2015, there were 558,000 passengers who did not claim for delayed or cancelled flights in and out of the UK. In fact, less that 40% of passengers claimed money back from their insurance policy.</p><p>They built a smart contract where the policy conditions were held on blockchain. Using the Oraclize service to connect the blockchain with the Internet, publicly available data is used to trigger the insurance policy.</p><p>In this case, a delayed flight is a matter of fact and public record. It does not rely on anyone’s judgement or individual assessment. It is what it is. If the event occurs, the smart contract gets triggered and the pay out is made. Automatic and immediate, with no claims processing costs for the insurer and satisfaction for the customer.</p><p>Building on this example and applying it to motor, smart contracts offer a solution for insurers to control claims costs after an accident. The trigger that there has been an accident would come from a smartphone app or the connected car via the Internet to the blockchain. Insurers are always frustrated when customers go a more expensive route for repairs, recovery and car hire. So, with a smart contract, insurers could code the policy conditions to only pay- out to the designated third parties (see related article by Sia Partners).</p><p>So long as the policy conditions are clear and unambiguous, and the conditions for paying out are objective, the insurance can be written in a smart contract. When the conditions are undeniably reached, the smart contract pays out. As blockchain startup SmartContract put it, “Any data feed trusted by a counterparty to release payment or simply complete an agreement, can power a smart contract.”</p><p>To understand this better, I asked Joshua Davis, the technical architect and co-founder at blockchain p2p InsurTech Dynamis to explain it to me, “you need well qualified oracle(s) to establish what “conditions” exist in the real world and when they have been “undeniably reached”.  An oracle is a bridge between the blockchain and the current state of places, people and things in the real world.  Without qualified oracles there can be no insurance that has any relation to the world that we live in.   </p><p>“As far as oracles go you can use either a single trusted oracle, who puts up a large escrow that is lost if they feed you misinformation, or many different oracles who don’t rely on the same POV or data sources to verify that events occurred.</p><p>“In the future social networks will be the cheapest and most used decentralized data feeds for various different insurance applications.  Our social networks will validate and verify our statements as lies or facts.  We need to be able to reliably contact a large enough segment of a claimant’s social network to obtain the truth.  If the insurance policy can monitor the publishing or notification of our current status to these participants and their responses accurately confirm it, then social networks will make for the cheapest most reliable oracles for all types of future claims validation efforts.”</p><h3>Is this simply too good to be true?</h3><p>Personally, I don’t think it is. Of course, a smart contract doesn’t have to be on the blockchain to deliver this use case.</p><p>However, what the blockchain offers is trust. And it offers provenance. The blockchain provides an immutable record and audit trail of an agreement. The policyholder does not have to rely on the insurer’s decision to pay them damages because they’ve broken their promise to keep them safe from harm. As the WEF report states, this is an “unbreakable escrow”. The insurer will pay out before they even know about it.</p><h3>There’s another reason for going with the blockchain – cybersecurity!</h3><p>With the blockchain sitting outside the corporate firewall and managed by many different and unconnected parties, the cyber criminal no longer has a single target to attack. As far as I’m aware, blockchain is immune to all of the conventional cyber threats that corporations are scared about.</p><p>What happens when you put blockchain and P2P Insurance together?</p><p>In December, I published a 2-part article on Peer 2 Peer Insurance (here are the links to Part 1 and Part 2). When you bring the P2P model together with the blockchain, this creates the potential for a near-autonomous self-regulated insurance business model for managing policy and claims.</p><p>Last year, Joshua Davis wrote an interesting white paper called “Peer to Peer Insurance on the Ethereum Blockchain”. In the paper, he presents the theory behind blockchain and the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (“DAO”). These are corporate entities with no human employees.</p><p>The DAOs would be created for groups of policyholders, in a similar way to the P2P group model of the likes of Guevara and Friendsurance. No single body or organization would control the DAO; it would be equally “controlled” by its policyholders within each group. All premiums paid in would create a pool of capital to pay claims.</p><p>And because this is a self-governing group with little or no overheads, any float at the end of the year would be redistributed back amongst the policyholders. Arguably, this makes the DAO a non-profit making organization and materially increases the capital reserve for claims costs.</p><p>The big question mark for this model is regulation. Who will maintain the blockchain code with in each DAO when regulations change does not yet have an answer. But, what does seem a dead cert is that someone, somewhere is figuring out how to solve this.</p><p>Blockchain offers the potential for new products and services that have never existed before in a P2P insurance model. It should also open up insurance to whole new markets, especially those on or near the poverty line.</p><p>For now, we watch to see what comes from the likes of Dynamis who are using smart contracts to provide supplementary employment insurance cover on Ethereum.</p><p>Innovation will come from new players</p><p>It has been my belief for some time that, in the main, incumbent insurance firms will not be able to materially innovate from within. Like Fintech, the innovation that will radically change this industry will come from new entrants and start-up players, such as; Dynamis, SmartContract, Rootstock, Everledger, Tradle, Ethereum Frontier.</p><p>This is particularly true with blockchain in insurance. These new age pioneers are unencumbered by corporate process, finance committees, bureaucracy and organisational resistance to change.</p><p>Besides, the incumbent insurance CIOs have heard this all before. For decades, software vendors have promised nirvana with new policy admin, claims and product engines. So why should they listen to the claims that blockchain is the panacea for their legacy IT issues. Which is a subject for another post… watch this space!</p><p>This article was first published at www.dailyfintech.com on Thursday 14th January 2016. Daily Fintech Advisers provide strategic consulting to organizations with business and investment interests in Fintech.</p><p>Third-party intervention may now prove unnecessary when interpreting and enforcing contract provisions—at least this is what proponents of smart contracts believe. The overall goal, they argue, is to provide security unattainable through traditional contract law, and to reduce additional transaction costs that come with the traditional process. Will insurance policies become the laboratory to test their thesis?</p><p>First imagined by computer scientist Nick Szabo in 1996, smart contracts are computer protocols meant to facilitate a contract’s implementation and performance. They can carry out only the specific instructions given to them, and all transactions are traceable and irreversible. Regarding functionality, experts have likened smart contracts to a vending machine; contract terms are first coded and placed within the block of a blockchain (the same technology Bitcoin uses). Once the triggering event occurs, the contract is performed consistent with all designated terms. Continuing the analogy, the individual inserting money in the vending machine sets off a chain of events, unable to be undone or halted midway. (Granted, this last part isn’t like the traditional vending machines we know.) The machine keeps the money and dispenses the item. The contract has been fully performed.</p><h3>Insurance Agreements</h3><p>Whether there is room for smart contracts in the insurance context remains to be seen. Generally, the “if this occurs, then that” nature of insurance policies lends itself to the conditional nature of smart contracts. In June 2017, AIG announced a partnership with IBM to develop a “smart insurance policy” for international markets. It will be interesting to follow this arrangement to see how well smart contracts can function in the insurance space. Smart contracts have the potential to play a helpful role in a variety of aspects within the industry. They could allow policy documents to be stored on numerous ledgers simultaneously, so that they are available for simultaneous review and amendment by multiple parties, and can never be lost or changed without the parties’ agreement. They may help secure policy documents and improve the claims process. They could remove administrative barriers and red tape throughout the system.</p><p>Further, smart contracts may affect the automated claims payment process. With smart contracts, policyholders could receive payments for uncontested claims immediately, instead of a month or more later, as under the current procedure. And the payouts could be sent directly to a customer’s account. Smart contract supporters ultimately hope the claims management process can be smoothed and predetermined by algorithms within a code. Such a development would likely enhance customer satisfaction and might ultimately lower insurer costs, with the potential to reduce premiums.</p><p>Natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes or earthquakes could constitute triggering events that give rise to payouts automatically. The contract might even be programmed to ascertain the physical scope of the event, which in turn could ease the adjustment process by cutting down time spent investigating and verifying the claim. Insurers could program smart contracts to decrease the potential for fraud. An insurer could program a payment to occur only when the policyholder uses a provider of its choosing, for instance, and can further program the money to automatically return if the insured does not abide by the terms of the agreement. The process could become more transparent.</p><h3>Potential Drawbacks</h3><p>Of course, smart contracts have their flaws. First, some proponents suggest that smart contracts may also help avoid ambiguities in policy language, thus preventing disputes and lawsuits over ambiguous policy terms. But it would be unrealistic to expect smart contracts to eliminate ambiguities and resulting disputes any more than such disputes are currently eliminated by traditionally written contracts. Before considering using smart contracts, policyholders would be advised to carefully review the proposed coverage terms and availability of recourse in the event of any issues.</p><p>Second, smart contracts must be coded by a third-party programmer, who must have the specialized knowledge necessary to design a contract that works well. Requiring a third party to program a smart contract touted for having the benefit of less involvement from outside professionals defeats one of the advantages of smart contracts. Third, it highlights another potential problem: human error. The hacking of The DAO, a “decentralized autonomous organization” for venture capital funding, serves as the most well-known case involving coding gone wrong, with nearly $60 million dollars’ worth of digital currency being compromised due to unaddressed security vulnerabilities. Not to mention the human input error that can arise in defining the scope of insurance coverage, such as covered entities, properties and values. Last, the insurance market is highly regulated, whereas smart contracts are not. Thus, smart insurance contracts may not be able to operate as smoothly in the insurance context as many anticipate.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>As we head towards a landscape filled with increased advanced technology, it seems smart contracts have potential. Insurance management could definitely stand to improve, and this may be one of the ways to push that process forward.</p></div>', 'en', '2018-03-06 15:17:18', '2018-03-06 15:17:18', '2019-10-24 10:11:21', '2022-04-10 20:36:05', '2022-04-10 20:36:05'),

As part of Web Summit, I attended MoneyConf, an insurtech and fintech conference, where the world’s leading insurance companies, banks, tech firms and disruptive startups met. Here, I spoke with industry leaders about how they were changing insurance’s long-standing image problem and improving user experience (UX) to better serve customers. Here is what they had to say:</p><div class=\"suggestion-content\"><h3>User Experience Is The New Battlefield</h3><p>Customers are unlikely to do business with any company that doesn’t give them a good experience. “Customers want simplicity, more clarity. \'What did I purchase when I signed the contract?\'” said Olaf Frank, head of global applications and interim CIO at Munich Re Group, one of the world’s leading reinsurers. Frank spoke about the propagation of insurance products and services tailored to the individual’s needs, such as on-demand insurance and personalized risk management products.</p><h3>Customers Want You To Know Them</h3><p>Insurtech leaders agree that it is all about KYC (know your customer) -- personalization is no longer just about using a client’s first name. With advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, a subset of machine learning, there is also talk of “deep personalization.” This would allow insurance companies to create products that are uniquely tailored to each customer. Imagine getting a policy that is custom-tailored to your exact needs, lets you start and stop coverage on demand, makes you pay only for the coverage you use, and that can be underwritten within seconds on your smartphone. Artificial intelligence will be key. “You will not be able to compete in the future if you don’t have the benefit of AI,” summarizes Frank.</p><p>Torbjørn Lomelde, head of marketing for Tryg, the second-largest supplier in the Nordic market for general insurance, agrees. “The trend is toward more personalized design, content and user experience. We need to both ask and listen to what [our] customers’ expectations are.” Lomelde emphasized the importance of delivering a positive and personalized user experience. Gartner predicts (via Digitalist Magazine) that smart personalization engines that can spot customer intent will cause digital businesses to boost their profits by up to 15%.</p><h3>Customers Want Self-Service</h3><p>This type of experience is what customers are starting to expect. “Insurance can be cool. It doesn’t have to be boring. If you are obsessed with customer (user) experience, you have a future,” said Amélie Oudéa-Castera, chief marketing and digital officer at AXA Group, one of the world’s largest insurance companies. “Online is surely the place to buy insurance. Don’t listen to those who say otherwise.”</p></div>', 'en', '2018-03-06 15:23:51', '2018-03-06 15:23:51', '2019-10-24 10:12:20', '2022-04-10 20:36:05', '2022-04-10 20:36:05'),

In Japan, trains can attain speeds of 240 km/h, but ongoing projects to raise peak speeds at 300 km/h aim at maintaining competitiveness of rail passenger transport versus air. In France, the TGV Sud-Est (Trains a Grande Vitesse) reaches speeds of 270 km/h while the TGV Atlantique can cruise at speeds of 300 km/h. One of the key advantages of such a system is since passenger trains have their exclusive tracks, the efficiency of rail freight transport increases as it inherits the almost exclusive use of the conventional rail system.</p>\n', 'en', '2018-11-22 13:36:37', '2018-11-22 13:36:37', '2021-10-05 15:14:07', '2022-04-10 20:36:05', '2022-04-10 20:36:05'),
(40, 'Alternative to Air Transport', '<p>High speed rail systems can have substantial impacts on other transport modes, even freight transport systems. One of the most apparent is on air transportation services between cities along the high speed rail corridor, particularly the most distant ones. High speed rail is able to compete successfully with short to medium distance air transport services as it conveys the advantage of servicing downtown areas and has much lower terminal time, mainly because of less security constraints. For city pairs closer than 500 km, the introduction of high speed rail services will in the majority of cases remove commercial air services as they cease to be competitive.</p>', 'en', '2018-11-22 13:37:26', '2018-11-22 13:37:26', '2019-09-28 15:08:24', '2022-04-10 20:36:05', '2022-04-10 20:36:05'),
(41, 'Freight Transportation', '<p>For freight transportation, there are several potential impacts, mostly indirect. The most straightforward is that since high speed rail uses its own right of way, the separation between passenger and freight systems promotes the efficiency and reliability of both networks. The main reason is that passengers and freight have different operational characteristics, namely in terms of speed and frequency of service. For each passenger car that is removed from regular rail lines an additional three freight rail cars can be accommodated by the new slot. The setting of high speed networks may also incite additional investments in rail freight infrastructure, particularly in metropolitan areas, better signaling technologies and cost sharing initiatives. Although there have been discussions about the potential of using high speed rail to move freight, these have not yet led to concrete realizations.</p>', 'en', '2018-11-22 13:40:26', '2018-11-22 13:40:26', '2019-09-28 15:08:29', '2022-04-10 20:36:05', '2022-04-10 20:36:05'),

In addition to present technologies, an entirely new technological paradigm has been under development in Japan and Germany since the late 1970s. The new technology is known as Maglev (Magnetic Levitation); it utilizes magnetic forces to uplift trains, guide them laterally and to propel them, relying upon highly efficient electromagnetic systems. The first commercial maglev rail system was inaugurated in Shanghai in 2003. Maglev systems have experienced some constraints on widespread commercialization, however, such as difficulties with integration in established rail corridors and perceptions of high construction costs.</p>', 'en', '2018-11-22 13:40:54', '2018-11-22 13:40:54', '2019-09-28 15:08:35', '2022-04-10 20:36:05', '2022-04-10 20:36:05'),

Musk says hyperloop capsules could reach a top speed of 760mph in around 70 seconds, which would see passengers experience 0.5G. We also experience lateral G-forces when going around a bend. To restrict these to 0.5G, the turning radius would be about 23.5km at 670mph. This requires routes to be kept almost straight or the capsules to slow right down when curves are necessary.

While vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) itself is not new – after all, quadcopters, tilt rotors and tilt wings are well-known concepts – we did not want to accept the compromises inherent to these configurations. Quadcopters excel with their simplicity but are highly inefficient in cruise flight. Transition aircraft can fly three times faster and ten times further with an equally sized battery, but system complexity is usually much higher. So, the goal was set: defining a transition aircraft concept with better performance in safety, noise, speed, range and payload than existing concepts, while cutting complexity to one third.</p>', 'en', '2018-11-22 13:52:52', '2018-11-22 13:52:52', '2019-09-28 15:08:53', '2022-04-10 20:36:06', '2022-04-10 20:36:06'),

From the first concept created in 2012, a lot of research and development has been done. We are proud to announce the brand new Next 2015 design. Elegant, minimal and sleek, but also more aerodynamic thanks to the new shape and the wheels integrated inside the structure.

Algae can produce biomass very rapidly, with some species doubling in as few as 6 h, and many exhibiting two doublings per day All algae have the capacity to produce energy-rich oils, and a number of microalgal species have been found to naturally accumulate high oil levels in total dry biomass. For example, some Botryococcus spp. have been identified that have up to 50% of their dry mass stored as long-chain hydrocarbons. The groups most often considered when discussing microalgae are diatoms, green algae, golden brown, prymnesiophytes, eustigmatophytes and cyanobacteria, and members from all of these groups have been examined as potential fuel production strains.

PBRs have advantages over open systems in that they can more easily maintain axenic cultures, and can maintain more controlled growth environments, which may lead to increases in productivity; however, contained systems are challenged by efficiencies in gas exchange and a requirement for supplemental cooling. Despite the advantages of decreased contamination and increased productivity, it is unclear whether PBRs will ever become cost competitive with open pond systems.</p>\n', 'en', '2018-11-22 14:24:09', '2018-11-22 14:24:09', '2021-08-05 13:02:49', '2022-04-10 20:36:06', '2022-04-10 20:36:06'),

Interestingly, the addition of iron to induce an algal bloom has been considered and tested as a strategy to sequester CO2. Biologically, iron is required for electron transport in all known photosynthetic organisms, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and is typically found in iron-sulfur clusters in a variety of photosynthetic proteins.</p>\n', 'en', '2018-11-22 14:28:27', '2018-11-22 14:28:27', '2021-08-23 12:23:18', '2022-04-10 20:36:06', '2022-04-10 20:36:06'),
(54, 'Oxidized Iron', '<p>Iron in its oxidized form is not optimal for uptake, and most algae prefer chelated iron. Fortunately, iron can be easily acquired and is more available than many of the other required nutrients. Sulfur, in addition to its key role in the electron transport chain, is also required for protein synthesis and lipid metabolism. Sulfur deficiency has been shown to limit algal density and stunt growth. Thus, it seems likely that sulfur will be important for optimal algal growth, and cost/benefit analysis will need to be considered to determine the optimal amount of sulfur to add to the media for the best economic return. The acquisition of the aforementioned nutrients, as well as potassium and at least nine other micro- and macro-nutrients, should not be overlooked when considering the implications of scaling algal biofuel production to meaningful levels.</p>\n', 'en', '2018-11-22 14:29:57', '2018-11-22 14:29:57', '2021-08-05 13:02:56', '2022-04-10 20:36:06', '2022-04-10 20:36:06');
